## Story
- In the game a death monster from the underworld named ”Skullo”, found his way to the world of living monsters and trying to escape from its guardians. 
- ”Skullo” has a unique ability to teleport. It took a lot of energy for ”Skullo” that he gathered throughout centuries to teleport to world of living monsters and now his powers are very limited and he can only teleport in short distances.

## Environment
- Precipice World, is the corridor-like dimension that connects Underworld and the World of Living Monster.
- Choice was made to switch from forrest to more tunnel-like environment due to technical and time restrictions and teleporting gameplay mechanic that would be more easier and effective to implement in tunnel.

## Compiling the code (OLD, not required anymore)
**In the new version, we only store the highscore of the player in local device. Firebase is now no longer needed.**
- To compile code, create ``Environment.cs`` in ``Assets`` folder according to your Firebase project.
```cs
public class Environment {

    public static string DatabaseURL = "YOUR_URL_HERE";

}
```
-->

## Compiling the code
Nothing required to compile our code at the moment.
